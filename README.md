# My first React Project - Todo App using React and API <img align="center" alt="Manu-React" height="30" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original.svg">

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What I used to create this: 

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): npm install react-router-dom
- [Library React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): npm install react-icons --save
- [Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping](https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/)

## Display

## Functionality
- You can click on the task and this will mark the task already done (the blue mark on the left side shows the tasks marked as done).
- You can delete a task by clicking on the x icon.
- If you click on the icon i it will give you more information about the task.
- In the part of "more information" about the task you will have a button to return.
- You can add more tasks by writting your task and clicking on "agregar".

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
